In this video, I will briefly explore the benefits and drawbacks of test-driven development. Test-driven development is a development approach that prioritizes testing before function development. Through the Roman Numeral Kata, I have discovered both advantages and challenges associated with this process.

Initially, I found Test-driven development to be a bit daunting. As someone accustomed to defining and writing functionalities first, I struggled to identify where to begin with unit tests. However, despite the obstacles, I believe Test-driven development offers three significant advantages. 

Firstly, Test-driven development allows us to break down functions into smaller parts, ensuring each function performs only a singular task. By doing so, we can quickly identify and resolve any issues. Secondly, by including documentation in unit tests, we can enable our colleagues to understand each function's purpose easily. Finally, we can ensure that our functions meet our requirements by failing unit tests and developing functional code to pass them. This approach allows us to guarantee that our functions meet our goals.
